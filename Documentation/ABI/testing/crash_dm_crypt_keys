Description:	read/write
		Make dm crypt keys persistent for the kdump kernel.

    Assume the key size won't exceed 256 bytes and the maximum number of keys is 128.

    You can write the following commands before kexec'ing the kdump kernel,
      - "init KEY_NUM"
        Initialize needed structures. KEY_NUM=128 at maximum.
      - "record KEY_DESC"
        Record a key description. For security reason, the key must be a logon
        key whose payload can't be read by user space. For details, please refer
        to security/keys/core.rst.
      - "reuse"
        Reuse the dm crypt keys stored in kdump reserved memory.

    And you can also read this API to know the command eructation status,
      - fresh
        Waiting for a command
      - initialized
        The "init KEY_NUM" command has been executed successfully
      - recorded
        Specified number of keys have been recorded
      - loaded
        the kdump kernel has been loaded with the dm crypt keys stored to kdump
        reserved memory
